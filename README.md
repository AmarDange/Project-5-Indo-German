## Agile Methodology
Throughout this project, an agile approach was taken in order to develop the website  Each activity was broken down into  manageable actions from initially creating 4 Epics, which were then broken down into smaller User Stories. Each of the user stories then had different acceptance criteria. The status, comments and details of each Epic along with the associated User Stories can be found in the kanban board linked [here](https://github.com/users/AmarDange/projects/7). This made the overall project much more manageable to build.
